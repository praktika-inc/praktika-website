# CSS Functionality Audit & Testing Results

## Current Site Analysis

### ‚úÖ **What the Site Actually Has:**
1. **Simple Navigation Menu** - Desktop horizontal nav, mobile hamburger menu
2. **No Dropdown Menus** - Navigation is flat, no nested menus
3. **No Forms** - No contact forms, signup forms, or input elements
4. **No Complex Interactions** - No lightboxes, sliders, tabs, or accordions
5. **Basic Responsive Design** - Mobile/desktop breakpoints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing CSS Classes (BUT LIKELY NOT NEEDED):**

#### Navigation Dropdowns (NOT USED)
- `w--nav-dropdown-open` - MISSING but site has no dropdowns
- `w--nav-dropdown-toggle-open` - MISSING but site has no dropdowns  
- `w--nav-dropdown-list-open` - MISSING but site has no dropdowns

#### Form States (NOT USED)
- `w-form-loading` - MISSING but site has no forms
- `w--redirected-checked` - MISSING but site has no custom form elements
- `w--redirected-focus` - MISSING but site has no form elements

#### Focus Management
- `wf-force-outline-none` - Potentially missing (need to check)

## Risk Assessment - UPDATED

### ‚úÖ **LOW RISK - Site Doesn't Use These Features**
1. **Form functionality** - Site has no forms, so missing form CSS is irrelevant
2. **Dropdown menus** - Site has simple flat navigation, no dropdowns
3. **Complex interactions** - Site is simple content site, no interactive components

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM RISK - Need to Verify**
1. **Focus management** - Important for accessibility, need to test keyboard navigation
2. **Link states** - Need to verify `w--current` works for active page states

### ‚úÖ **ALREADY FIXED**
1. **Mobile menu** - `[data-nav-menu-open]` restored and working
