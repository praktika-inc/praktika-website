Before describing why, when, how, and what personal user data "Praktika" collects and processes, let us explain some basic concepts about protecting personal data. We believe that this will allow you to better understand why we choose our way of processing personal data.


### Personal Data
Personal data is any information about an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is a natural person that can be directly or indirectly identified, particularly by referring to a specific identifier (name, number, network identifier, email address) or to one or several specific elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural, or social identity of the individual.

### Data Subject
A data subject is an individual that the personal data relates to and that can be identified by personal data or is identifiable.

### Special Categories of Personal Data
We exclude or try to minimize the collection of such categories of data in our app, but they are worth mentioning. By such personal data, we mean anything that may cause harm to the data subject in personal life, at work, at the university, or may lead to discrimination. Such personal data usually reflects racial or ethnic origin, political views, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union memberships, or there is a processing of genetic and biometric data to uniquely identify an individual and gather data about the individual's health, sex life, or sexual orientation.

### Personal Data Administrator

An administrator is a natural or legal person who determines the purposes and means of personal data processing and is primarily responsible for its processing. Unless otherwise specified in the terms or conditions for a particular service, the personal data administrator is the CEO of PRAKTIKA, INC., Anton Shayakhov.

### Personal Data Operator

An operator is a natural or legal person that processes personal data for the administrator based on their instructions.

### Personal Data Processing

Processing is any activity or a set of activities that are performed with personal data or sets of personal data with or without using automatic procedures, such as collecting, recording, systematizing, structuring, storing, refining or changing, searching, viewing, using, accessing during transfer, distributing or granting any access, arranging or combining, restricting, deleting, or destructing.

## What Type of Information Do We Collect?

"Praktika" is an app that helps users learn meditation. You can use our services without registering or after registering in the app. By registering in the mobile app, you consent to personal data processing, and in turn, we process your data to provide the service as specified in this agreement. The user can provide the following data categories: email address. Registration is carried out by signing in to Google or Apple user accounts.

We want to keep you informed about any changes in our service, promotions, and advertising campaigns or technical improvements carried out by our team. If you agree with this condition, we may use your email address for, among other reasons, sending you such information.

## How Long Is My Personal Data Stored?

Generally, we store the personal data we collect from users until it no longer satisfies the purpose for its collection. If, at any point, you want to opt out of personal data processing, you can always do so by sending an email to hi@praktika.app.

Conversations, including emails sent to our support team, will be stored longer so that we will be able to access them for any subsequent inquiries. Such information is deleted after three years unless requested by law.

Anonymous information about your activity is stored longer for statistical data and market research, but it is not associated with you and is anonymous. This is because we strive to improve our services and opportunities for more convenient communication, and our legitimate interest justifies such a storage period.

## What Kind of Personal Information Is Collected About Minors?

Praktika intentionally does not collect any information about minors. We do not encourage the use of our service by minors without the consent of legal representatives. If we are made aware that such data has been provided by a minor (as defined by the law of the user's country of residence), and their personal data has been provided without the consent of their legal representatives, we will take measures to notify the data subject's legal representatives to obtain appropriate permission or to delete the personal data of an underage data subject.

## Does Praktika Share My Personal Data?
