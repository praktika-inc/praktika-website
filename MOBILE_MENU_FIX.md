# Mobile Menu Fix Documentation

## Issue
After CSS cleanup, the mobile hamburger menu was no longer opening when clicked on small screens. The burger button appeared but clicking it had no effect.

## Root Cause
During the CSS cleanup of `_sass/_webflow.scss`, we removed the essential CSS rule for `[data-nav-menu-open]` which is used by the Webflow JavaScript to show the mobile menu when the hamburger button is clicked.

## Solution
Added back the essential CSS rule for mobile menu visibility:

```scss
/* Mobile menu visibility when opened */
[data-nav-menu-open] {
  display: block !important;
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background: #C8C8C8;
  text-align: center;
  overflow: visible;
  min-width: 200px;
}
```

## How it Works
1. The hamburger button (.w-nav-button) is visible on mobile screens
2. When clicked, Webflow's JavaScript (`assets/js/webflow.js`) adds the `data-nav-menu-open` attribute to the nav menu
3. The CSS rule `[data-nav-menu-open]` makes the menu visible with proper positioning
4. The menu appears as a dropdown below the navigation bar

## Files Modified
- `_sass/_webflow.scss` - Added back the `[data-nav-menu-open]` rule

## Testing
- ✅ Site builds successfully
- ✅ Mobile menu button appears on small screens
- ✅ Mobile menu opens when clicked
- ✅ Menu items are properly styled and accessible

## Future Considerations
This CSS rule is essential for mobile navigation functionality and should be preserved in any future CSS cleanup efforts.
